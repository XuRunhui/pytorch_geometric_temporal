# Debug configuration specifically for new normalization strategy validation
# @package data

# Inherit from advanced normalization config
defaults:
  - advanced_norm

# Debug overrides
batch_size: 4             # Small batch for detailed inspection
num_workers: 0            # Single-threaded for debugging
max_stocks: 50            # Limited stocks for faster processing
sequence_length: 10       # Shorter sequences for quick validation

# Enable detailed logging for normalization validation
debug: true               # Enable detailed normalization logging
persistent_workers: false # Not needed with 0 workers
drop_last: false         # Keep all data for validation
pin_memory: false        # Disable for CPU debugging

# Quick data splits for validation
train_ratio: 0.8
val_ratio: 0.1
test_ratio: 0.1

# Single prediction horizon for focused testing
prediction_horizons: [5]

# Comments for debugging usage:
# Use this config to validate the new normalization strategy:
# python train_stock_gnn_hydra.py data=debug_norm_validation
# 
# This will:
# 1. Print detailed normalization statistics
# 2. Validate that price features are properly normalized by close
# 3. Validate that returns are cross-section normalized
# 4. Use small batches for manual inspection
